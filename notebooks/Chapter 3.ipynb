However, we can often identify an unusual value by looking at a figure. When one or more samples are suspected to be outliers, the first step is to make sure that the values are scientifically valid and that no data recording errors have occured. Great care should be taken not to hastily remove or change values, especially if the sample size is small. With small sample sizes, apparent outliers might be a result of a skewed distribution where there are not yet enough data to see the skewness. Also, the outlying data may be an indication of a special part of the population under study that is just starting to be sampled. Depending on how the data were collected, a \"cluster\" of valid points that reside outside the mainstream of the data might belong to a different population than the other samples, e.g. *extrapolation* and *applicability domain*.

Second, if two predictors are highly correlated, this implies that they are measuring the same underlying information. Removing one should not compromise the performance of the model and might lead to a more parsimonious and interpretable model. Third, some models can be crippled by predictors with degenerate distributions, e.g. near-zero variance predictors. In these cases, there can be a significant improvement in model performance and/or stability without the problematic variables."

Models that include an intercept term, such as simple linear model, would have numerical issues if each dummy variable was included in the model. The reason is that, for each sample, these variables all add up to one and this would provide the same information as the intercept.
